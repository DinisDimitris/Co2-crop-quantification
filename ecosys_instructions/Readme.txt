The txt files show the parameters ecosys takes in for simulations.

Runfile is the main file where all parameter files are aggregated, the command to run the simulation is:

ecosys.x < runfile where ecosys.x is the executable created after compiling

!! When creating a parameter file the lines where the parameters are located should be respected and separated by commas !! 

If no type is specified to the parameters, it is assumed to be INT/FLOAT
