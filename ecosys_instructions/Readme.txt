The txt files show the parameters ecosys takes in for simulations.

Runfile is the main file where all parameter files are aggregated, the command to run the simulation is:

ecosys.x < runfile where ecosys.x is the executable created after compiling

!! When creating a parameter file the lines where the parameters are located should be respected and separated by commas !! 

The types are floats by default, therefore unless explicitly specified, they should be inserted as floats 

output files are files where the outputs will be written to, therefore they only need to be created

If file data is not available, type NO
